1. Create list with 10 items
a) product of each list element in myProductList
b)adding of each list element in myEachAddList

val myList:List[Int] = List(1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,15,17)
for(myProductList <- myList) {
  println(myProductList * myProductList)
}
val myList:List[Int] = List(1,3,5,6,7,9,11,13,15,17)
for(myEachAddList <- myList) {
  println(myEachAddList + myEachAddList)
}
2. Mutable list and immutable list of Scala
 A mutable list is a list in which elements can be added, edited or deleted.
 An immutable list is a list where the elements of the list cannot be changed.
 val a= List(1,2,3,4,5,6)
 a = List(2,3,4,5,6,7) ==> gives an error since "val" creates a immutable list and the variable 'a' cannot be assigned with anything else.
 
 Var a = List(1,2,3,4,5,6)
 a = List(2,3,4,5,6,7) changes the value of a
 
3. Remove duplicates from List
val myList = List(1,1,1,3,4,4,5,7)
print(myList.distinct)

4. Create Map of strings
a) print keys and values
b)print only keys 
c) print only values
var marksList = Map("Kim" -> 95, "Ben" -> 85, "Pat" -> 90 )
for ((k,v) <- marksList){
  printf("key:%s, value:%s\n", k, v)
}
for ((k,v) <- marksList){
  printf("key:%s\n", k)
}
for ((k,v) <- marksList){
  printf("value:%s\n", v)
}
5. Create a list of 1 to 20
a)list of odd numbers as another list
b)list of even number as another list
val myList = List(1 to 20)
